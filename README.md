## Install

```

## Usage
### Linking the Library
In order to use Speech, you must first link the library your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries.html#content).

### Speaking an Utterance
Once you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:

```js
var Speech = require('react-native-speech');
```

Speaking an utterance is as simple as calling:
```js
Speech.speak({
  text: 'React Native Speech is awesome!  I\'m going to use it in my next project.',
  voice: 'en-US'
});
```

## Example
Using Speech in your app will usually look like this:
```js
var Speech = require('react-native-speech');

var YourComponent = React.createClass({
  _startHandler() {
    Speech.speak({
      text: 'Nous faisons le test 1',
      voice: 'fr-FR'
    })
    .then(started => {
      console.log('Fin du test 1');
      return Speech.speak({
        text: 'Et voilÃ  le test 2',
        voice: 'fr-FR'
      })
    })
    .then(started => {
      console.log('Fin du test 2');
      return Speech.speak({
        text: 'Et maintenant le test 3',
        voice: 'fr-FR'
      })
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log('You\'ve already started a speech instance.');
    });
  },

  _pauseHandler() {
    Speech.pause();
  },

  _resumeHandler() {
    Speech.resume();
  },

  _stopHandler() {
    Speech.stop();
  },

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        ...
        <Button onPress={this._startHandler}>
          Speak
        </Button>
        <Button onPress={this._pauseHandler}>
          Pause
        </Button>
        <Button onPress={this._resumeHandler}>
          Resume
        </Button>
        <Button onPress={this._stopHandler}>
          Stop
        </Button>
      </View>
    );
  }
});
```
